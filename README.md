# Benevolence App

The Benevolence App is a solution that integrates with Planning Center to provide meals, services, and item donations to those in need. It was developed in response to the lack of a built-in solution within Planning Center.

In order to use this solution your organization needs a Planning Center account. Don't have one? Sign up for a free here: [https://www.planningcenter.com/](https://www.planningcenter.com/)
